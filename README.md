# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for
# RWAvengers â€” Carbon Credit Tokenization (Monad Blitz)

A fast, minimal RWA prototype that mints verifiable **carbon credit tokens** on Monad Testnet and exposes a simple front-end for registry/retire flows.

---

## âœ¨ TL;DR
- **Problem:** Carbon credits are fragmented, slow to verify, and opaque at retirement.
- **Solution:** Batch-minted carbon credits with embedded metadata (project, methodology, vintage), on-chain registry, and **verifiable retirement** with proofs + off-chain MRV attestations.
- **Stack:** Solidity (EVM), minimal Node/TypeScript front-end, wallet + explorer integration for Monad testnet.

## ğŸ§± Architecture (High-level)

> **MRV = Measurement, Reporting, Verification.** We reference an off-chain attestation (URI or hash) per minted batch and per retirement.
