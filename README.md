# RWAvengers â€” Carbon Credit Tokenization (Monad Blitz)

A fast, minimal RWA prototype that mints verifiable **carbon credit tokens** on Monad Testnet and exposes a simple front-end for registry/retire flows.

---

## âœ¨ TL;DR
- **Problem:** Carbon credits are fragmented, slow to verify, and opaque at retirement.
- **Solution:** Batch-minted carbon credits with embedded metadata (project, methodology, vintage), on-chain registry, and **verifiable retirement** with proofs + off-chain MRV attestations.
- **Stack:** Solidity (EVM), minimal Node/TypeScript front-end, wallet + explorer integration for Monad testnet.

> **MRV = Measurement, Reporting, Verification.** We reference an off-chain attestation per minted batch and per retirement.

## Closing & Next Steps

- **Ship demo:** Deploy to Monad testnet, pin sample MRV packages, and showcase mint â†’ verify â†’ retire in one session.
- **Improve attestations:** Add EAS or dedicated signature schemas for attestors; standardize MRV JSON.
- **Compliance hooks:** Optional allow-lists/KYC adapters for regulated contexts.
- **Analytics:** Stand up a lightweight indexer and a dashboard for batch inventory and retirement leaderboards.
- **Contributions welcome:** Open issues or submit a PR with focused improvements (tests, gas nudges, UX polish).
